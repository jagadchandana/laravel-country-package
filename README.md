**Laravel package to get country data, codes, dial codes, flags, and more.**

## About

This package provides an easy way to access country information such as country names, ISO codes, dial codes, flags, currency, languages, and other details inside your Laravel application.

You can fetch all countries, search by country code, or search by country name easily using a simple API.

This package loads data from a JSON file bundled within the package â€” so it works offline with no external API calls.
